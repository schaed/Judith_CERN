Calculates the coefficients (and their uncertainties) to be applied to test beam data to correct for the effect of the telescope resolution.
The function to call is 

    int makeMap(...)

defined in makeMap.C.
The full arguments list is

    int makeMap(const double pixX = 50., // pixel size X
                const double pixY = 50., // pixel size Y
                const double resX = 8., // telescope resolution X
                const double resY = 8., // telescope resolution Y
                const double resErrX = 1., // uncertainty on telescope resolution X
                const double resErrY = 1., // uncertainty on telescope resolution Y
                const double gridX = 1., // size of the divisions of the grid in X
                const double gridY = 1., // size of the divisions of the grid in Y
                const unsigned int clusterType = CLUSTERTYPE_SINGLE, // cluster type: 1 = single pixel, 2 = 2 adjacent pixels, 3 = 3 pixels (L shape), 4 = 2x2 pixels block
                const unsigned int integratorType = INTEGRATORTYPE_ADAPTIVE, // integrator type: 0 = adaptive, 1 = GSLMC (slow)
                const  bool holdPlot = false) // leaves the TCanvas open at the end of the script

The output is saved in the maps/ folder.
WARNING: choose gridX (gridY) properly. If gridX (gridY) is not an integer dividend of the sensor surface's range xMax-xMin (yMax-yMin) - xMax,xMin,yMax,yMin are defined by function defineSurface(...) in makeMap.h - the maps will most likely present Moiree patterns.
